# Controllable Exploration-Exploitation in User-Item Interactions  
**Pane-Aware Graph Transformer Architecture**

This repository contains the implementation of the paper submitted to *TKDE*:  
*"Controllable Exploration-Exploitation in User-Item Interactions Toward Long-Term Recommendation Gains: A Pane-Aware Graph Transformer Architecture."*

## Requirements
- Python ≥ 3.8
- RecBole library (please install before running)

> ⚠️ Note: The functions for long-tail evaluation require modifications to the RecBole source code.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install recbole


2. Apply the necessary RecBole modifications for long-tail metrics.
3. Run the training scripts as described in the paper.
